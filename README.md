# Soybean Disease Detection & Advisory System 🌱

This is my first GitHub project.

This project implements an AI-based system that analyzes soybean leaf images
and determines whether the crop is healthy or affected by a disease.
Based on the detected disease pattern, the system automatically provides
recommendations related to fertilizer usage, irrigation management,
and treatment actions.

## Features
- Soybean-specific leaf disease detection
- Works on real field images
- Automated health status and advisory report
- Fertilizer, water, and treatment recommendations
- No internet required after training

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Scope
This system is designed only for soybean leaf images.
Predictions for other crop images are outside the scope of this project.

## Model File
The trained model file (.h5) is not included in this repository
because it exceeds GitHub's file size limit.
The notebook contains the complete training and model generation code.

## How to Use
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook file.
2. Place a soybean leaf image in the project folder.
3. Run the prediction cell.
4. The system will generate a health and advisory report automatically.

## Note
This is my first GitHub project.
